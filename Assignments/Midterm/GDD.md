CONCEPT
The game is an endless-faller sort of like if flappy bird was rotated 90ยบ clockwise. the longer you survive the higher a score you get

CORE MECHANICS
the player can move the charecter around to avoid obstacles and collect powerups. thats about it.

CONTROL SCHEMES
The player will move around using either the arrow keys or the mouse (i havent decided which yet. hopefully the mouse.)

ART STYLE
Art style will be simple. Art isnt my top priority so expect something pretty basic uless I have the time. The games aspect ratio is such that it would fit nicely on smartphones.

WIN/LOSS CONDITIONS
The player cant win. they lose if they touch an obstacle.
