### Overview

I have a very hard time picking a favorite game, but for the sake of this assignment I'm going to go with Celeste because I think it's a very well-rounded game in terms of visual style, gameplay, music, and story. Celeste was developed by [EXOK Games](https://exok.com/games.html) and released in January of 2018. It was made using MonoGame.

### Similar Games

Celeste is similar in style to another EXOK developed game title [Towerfall](https://exok.com/games/towerfall/) and is based on a game from a game jam that has now been dubbed [Celeste Classic](https://maddymakesgamesinc.itch.io/celesteclassic)
